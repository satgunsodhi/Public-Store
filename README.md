## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- React Router v7
- Chakra UI for styling
- Zustand for state management
- Vite for build tooling

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- RESTful API architecture

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- MongoDB account and connection string
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/product-store.git
   cd product-store
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your MongoDB connection string:
   ```
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   PORT=5000
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

3. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

4. Start the development server
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start both the backend server and the frontend development server concurrently.
